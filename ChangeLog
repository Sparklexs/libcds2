	Merging with develop

	Adding a configuration file to make the use of post-review easier.

	Changing the licence. We got authorization from Rodrigo Gonzalez, so everything is in order.

2012-02-12  Francisco Claude  <fclaude@gmail.com>

	Library compiles and passes the tests in 32 bits machines too.

	Fixing extra blank lines.

	Updating readme.md to include latests changes to the project.

	big set of changes: - makefile now supports:   - make indent: requires astyle.   - make cpplint: checks for style errors in the code. - the cpplint original file was modified to allow a space after catch. - all code has been adapted to pass the style tests. - all .h files of the gtest library went through a bcpp (this was not on purpose)

	The timer test has been removed. It tends to give a false negative.

	The main makefile was calling make in the gtest directory, but not configure. This would cause the library to fail to compile the tests for other users.

2012-02-11  Francisco Claude  <fclaude@gmail.com>

	Improved readability of basic and tests.

	Added gtest and fixed makefile to compile in Mac OSX.

2011-08-18  Francisco Claude  <fclaude@cs.uwaterloo.ca>

	forgot to add the lib directory, now it should compile on other people's machines

	Merge branch 'develop' of github.com:fclaude/libcds2 into develop

	ok, Makefile done, this one is simpler than the one for libcds1. I assumed that there are going to be few test binaries and thus more effort into them is not worth it.

	improving the makefile, this is a commit to register some file I'll erase

2011-05-19  Francisco Claude  <fclaude@cs.uwaterloo.ca>

	changed the representation of cds_word to size_t, also patched io.h to support reading files in 32bits.

2011-05-18  Francisco Claude  <fclaude@cs.uwaterloo.ca>

	Fixed msb() function on 32 bits (detected on virtual machine).

2011-05-16  Francisco Claude  <fclaude@cs.uwaterloo.ca>

	Fixed a number that was too long for 32bits (adding ull at the end).

2011-05-16  Francisco Claude  <fclaude@cs.uwaterloo.ca>

	Finished the skeleton for basic and started defining BitSequence
	Added the following to src/basic:
	- CDSException: Base exception class, for now a very simple version, we can start pushing this direction further if we see that we are actually using it.
	- Timer: basic timer to measure time, it is not as aqurate as we would like, it is a good candidate for replacing in the future.
	- io.h: I/O and parsing functions.

	The bitsequence.h file contains the definition for BitSequence, the base class from which RG, RRR, SD are going to inherit.

2011-05-13  Francisco Claude  <fclaude@cs.uwaterloo.ca>

	Merge branch 'master' of github.com:fclaude/libcds2

	Fixed link to libcds1

2011-05-13  Francisco Claude  <fclaude@cs.uwaterloo.ca>

	Base code
	- First version of libcds.h and its test
	- Temporary Makefile

	This file determines how the bits are read and written to the memory,
	the rest of the code should use these functions (or compatible ones).

	The makefile is temporary, just a quick hack to compile the test we
	have so far.

2011-05-13  alexbowe  <bowe.alexander@gmail.com>

	Fix markdown bullet points

	Add initial readme
	The readme includes these sections:
	 - Brief rationale in order to explain the projects goals.
	 - Some useful links relating to the project.
	 - Some brief guidelines about using git.

	Initial commit
