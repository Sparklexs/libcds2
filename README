LIBCDS 2 - A Compressed Data Structure Library
================================================

Rationale
---------
LIBCDS 2 is the re-coding of [LIBCDS][libcds1] with these goals:

 - 64-Bit support to allow for larger, single structures.
 - Speedups
 - Improve code readability
 - Include unit tests ([googletest][googtest])
 - Improve documentation

Further long-term goals include:

 - Introduce missing types to the library.
 - Provide packages for common GNU/Linux distributions, and other OSs.
 - Provide the option of installing it as a shared library (easing compilation and updates).
 - Wrappers for popular programming languages.

Guidelines
----------

 - If you make changes to autoconf files (configure.ac or Makefile.am files), please rerun autoconf like so: `autoreconf -vif --no-recursive`.

 - When you commit, it is useful to give a good message.

 - The code tries to follow this style guide [C++ Style Guide][cppstyle].

 - Before commiting, please make sure you run all tests and 'make cpplint/indent' to check for style errors.
